When using alpha characters for cipher text it is normal to group the letters into 5 letter clusters, regardless of word boundaries. This helps obfuscate any patterns. This file has kept the plain text word boundaries and carried them to the cipher text. Enjoy!",

Without any further information, this cipher text may be difficult to break. You do not have direct access to the key, however you do have access to a program that will encrypt anything you wish to give it using the key. If you think logically, this is completely easy. One shot can solve it! The encrypt binary will look for the keyfile in your current working directory. Therefore, it might be best to create a working direcory in /tmp and in there a link to the keyfile. As the encrypt binary runs setuid krypton3, you also need to give krypton3 access to your working directory.",

It will read the keyfile and encrypt any message you desire, using the key AND a 'random' number. You get to perform a 'known ciphertext' attack by introducing plaintext of your choice. The challenge here is not simple, but the 'random' number generator is weak. As stated, it is now that we suggest you begin to use public tools, like cryptool, to help in your analysis. You will most likely need a hint to get going. See 'HINT1' if you need a kickstart. If you have further difficulty, there is a hint in 'HINT2'.
